            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Depression, also known as depressive disorder, is a common mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. It's more than just typical mood fluctuations and can significantly impact all areas of life, 
                affecting relationships, school performance, and work productivity.</p>

            <p>While anyone can experience depression, certain factors increase the risk, such as past trauma, significant loss, or stressful life events. 
                Women are more prone to depression than men.</p>

            <p>Globally, an estimated 280 million people live with depression. This represents about 3.8% of the population, 
                including 5% of adults (with a gender breakdown of 4% for men and 6% for women) and 5.7% of adults over 60. 
                Depression is roughly 50% more common in women compared to men. Furthermore, over 10% of pregnant women and new mothers experience depression worldwide. 
                Tragically, depression is a contributing factor to the over 700,000 suicide deaths annually, 
                making suicide the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds.</p>
            
            <p>Effective treatments for depression exist, yet access remains a significant challenge. In low- and middle-income countries, over 75% of those affected receive no treatment. 
                Obstacles to care include insufficient funding for mental health services, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, 
                and the pervasive social stigma surrounding mental illness.</p>

        <div class="block" id="symptoms">
            <h1>Symptoms and patterns</h1>
            <p>During a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty).
                They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities.</p>
            
            <p>A depressive episode is different from regular mood fluctuations. They last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.</p>
            <p>Other symptoms are also present, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor concentration</li>
                <li>feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth</li>
                <li>hopelessness about the future</li>
                <li>thoughts about dying or suicide</li>
                <li>disrupted sleep</li>
                <li>changes in appetite or weight</li>
                <li>feeling very tired or low in energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including in the community and at home, work and school.</p>
            <p>The severity of a depressive episode is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the number and intensity of symptoms 
                and how significantly they affect a person's ability to function.</p>
            <p>Depressive episodes can present in different patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Episode Depressive Disorder:</strong> This refers to a person's first and only depressive episode.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurrent Depressive Disorder:</strong> This diagnosis is given when a person has experienced at least two separate depressive episodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Bipolar Disorder:</strong>In this case, depressive episodes alternate with periods of mania. Manic symptoms include elevated mood (euphoria or irritability), increased energy and activity, rapid speech, 
                    racing thoughts, inflated self-esteem, reduced need for sleep, difficulty focusing, and impulsive or reckless behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h1>Contributing factors and prevention</h1>
            <p>Depression arises from a complex interplay of social, psychological, and biological factors. 
                Experiencing adverse life events like unemployment, the death of a loved one, or trauma significantly increases the risk of developing depression. 
                Furthermore, depression can create a vicious cycle, leading to increased stress and dysfunction, 
                which in turn worsens the individual's life circumstances and exacerbates the depression itself.</p>
            
            <p>There's a close link between depression and physical health. Many factors that contribute to depression, such as lack of physical activity and 
                harmful alcohol use, are also risk factors for chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses. 
                Conversely, individuals managing these chronic conditions may experience depression due to the challenges associated with their illness.</p>

            <p>Preventive programs have proven effective in reducing the incidence of depression. 
                Successful community-based approaches include school programs that teach positive coping strategies to children and adolescents. 
                Interventions aimed at parents of children with behavioral problems can also decrease parental depression and improve outcomes for their children. 
                Exercise programs tailored for older adults have also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing depression.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block" id="treatment">
            <h1>Diagnosis and treatment</h1>
            <p>Effective treatments are available for depression, including psychological therapies and medication. 
                It's important to seek professional help if you are experiencing symptoms of depression.</p>

            <p>Psychological treatments are the first line of treatment for depression. For moderate to severe cases, 
                they can be combined with antidepressant medication. However, medication is typically not necessary for mild depression.</p>

            <p>Psychological treatments teach individuals new ways of thinking, coping with challenges, and interacting with others. 
                These treatments can involve talk therapy with mental health professionals or supervised lay therapists, 
                either in person or online. Self-help resources like manuals, websites, and apps can also be beneficial.</p>

            <p>Effective psychological treatments for depression include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Behavioral Activation</li>
                <li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</li>
                <li>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</li>
                <li>Problem-Solving Therapy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Antidepressant medications, 
                such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, are sometimes prescribed. Healthcare providers should consider potential side effects, 
                the feasibility of delivering the treatment (considering expertise and availability), and individual patient preferences when making treatment decisions.</p>
            
            <p>Antidepressants are not recommended for treating depression in children and are not the first-line treatment for adolescents. If used in adolescents, they should be prescribed with caution.</p>
            <p>Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder, as it requires a distinct approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block" id="self-care">
            <h1>Self-care</h1>
